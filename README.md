## Hi there 👋

I’m a Principal Designer at Microsoft Digital, where I lead AI‑driven design strategy and help shape the future of agentic experiences, governance, and enterprise UX.

I work across large-scale systems, from Digital Assets Governance experiences, Azure DevOps, Network and Device Copilots, and I explore how AI, decentralization, and emerging technologies reshape design practice.
